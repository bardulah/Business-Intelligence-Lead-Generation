# Instructions for Lead Discovery & Research Tool

This guide provides instructions on how to use the Lead Discovery & Research Tool.

## What It Does

This is a business intelligence tool that helps you automatically find and research new business leads. It analyzes a company's online presence (like their website and GitHub repositories) to give you a "Lead Score," helping you understand which opportunities are most promising.

## How to Use It

The application is a web-based dashboard, accessible at **[https://curak.xyz](https://curak.xyz)**.

### 1. Analyzing a Lead

The main feature is the analysis tool. You can provide one of two things as input:

*   **A GitHub Repository:** For example, `facebook/react` or `https://github.com/facebook/react`.
*   **A Website URL:** For example, `example.com` or `https://example.com`.

The tool will then analyze the target and provide a detailed report, including:
*   **Technology Stack:** What software and tools the company uses.
*   **Company Profile:** Information about the company's size and online presence.
*   **Contact Information:** Publicly available contact details.
*   **Lead Score:** A score from 0-100 indicating the lead's potential.

### 2. Understanding the Dashboard

The main dashboard displays your analyzed leads as "Lead Cards." Each card provides a quick summary. You can click on any card to see the full, detailed analysis.

### 3. Filtering and Sorting

You can use the filter panel on the dashboard to:
*   **Filter by Priority:** Show only "High," "Medium," or "Low" priority leads.
*   **Set a Minimum Score:** Hide leads that are below a certain score.
*   **Sort Results:** Order your leads by their score or by how recently they were analyzed.

### 4. Exporting Leads

If you want to use the data in another application (like a spreadsheet or CRM), you can export it.
1.  Click the **Export** button in the header.
2.  Choose your desired format:
    *   **CSV:** For spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets).
    *   **JSON:** For use in other software.
    *   **PDF:** For creating professional, shareable reports.

This tool is designed to streamline your lead generation process by providing deep, actionable insights with minimal effort.
